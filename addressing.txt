Addressing scheme in the Fat Tree topology
------------------------------------------

There are four types of nodes (class ftnode) in the fat tree network (class
fattree), namely host, edge, aggregation and core. Each node has one or more
ports (class ftport or class rlport). Each port bears a 32-bit unsigned
integer as its address. In the fat-tree network, we assume the switch
components are homogeneous with 2N ports. That is, for example, each edge
switch connects to N hosts and N aggregation switches. Here we assign
      n = log_2 (N-1)

The addressing scheme is as follows: For the ports that connects between
host, edge and aggregation, they are of 5 segments:

Address           Scheme
               | (n+1)-bit | 1-bit | n-bit | 2-bit | n-bit |
Host ports        Pod ID       0    Edge ID   00    Host ID

Agg. ports        Pod ID       0    Edge ID   01    Agg. ID
(towards edge)

Edge ports        Pod ID       0    Edge ID   11    Agg. ID
(towards agg.)

Edge ports        Pod ID       0    Edge ID   10    Host ID
(towards host)


The Host ID is counting from zero onward and unique within an edge switch. The
Edge and Aggregation ID are also counting from zero onward and unique within an
pod. The Pod ID is counting from zero onward and unique to the whole network.

The addressing scheme for the ports that connects between the aggregation and
core switches are of 5 segments:

Address           Scheme
               | (n+1)-bit | 1-bit | 2-bit | n-bit | n-bit |
Agg. ports        Pod ID       1      00    Agg. ID Core ID
(towards core)

Core ports        Pod ID       1      01    Core ID Agg. ID
(towards agg.)

The Aggregation ID is same as the one abovementioned. The core switches are
grouped into N groups and numbered with ID from zero to N-1 in each group. This
means the aggregation switch of ID j connects to all the N core switches in
group j, and core switches in group j connects to the aggregation switches of
ID j in all pods. Since core switches do not belongs to any pods, the pod ID in
the above correspond to the pod of the aggregation switch concerned.

The addressing scheme above creates an address of (3n+4)-bit for each port. The
address is prefixed with zeros to make up the 32-bit.

As an example, the i-th host connected to the j-th edge switch in the k-th pod
bears the address that can be constructed by:
        int n = log2(N-1);
	unsigned address = (((((((k<<1)+0)<<n)+j)<<2)+0)<<n)+i;
